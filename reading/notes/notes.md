### Linear Algebra Review
#### Basic Notation

 - By convention, an n-dimensional vector is often thought of as a matrix with *n* rows and *1* column, known as a **column vector**. $$  \begin{equation}
     x =\begin{bmatrix}
         x_{1} \\
         x_{2} \\
         \vdots \\
         x_{n} \\
        \end{bmatrix}
  \end{equation} $$
  
#### Different Interpretation of Matrix-Vector Multiplication

 - inner product of each *row* of $A$ and $x$
 - **linear combination** of *columns* of $A$

 
#### Matrix-Matrix Product Interpretations
 - set of vector-vector products.
 - sum of outer products.
 - set of matrix vector product
 


### Probability Review

### Convex Optimization Review
